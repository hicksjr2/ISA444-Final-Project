# Business Forecasting Using Statistical, ML, Deep Learning and Transformer Models

In this class project, we utilize the [Walmart Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast) to compare various statistical models  for time series. 
Given that the dataset contained XYZ different time-series, we focused on ABC time-series. We picked these timeseries **as they** ... 

## Forecasting Procedure
Our approach consisted of the following steps:  
  1. Loaded, cleaned & downsampled the Walmart dataset to 40 time-series & condensed to a CSV file. We re-shaped the data to match Nixtla's three-column format. 
  2.
